# Fitness Friends
A full-stack application to share and keep track of workouts, meal plans, diets and fitness progress.

## Description
The main purpose to build this was to create a platform where users can track their fitness progress by logging their workouts. Users are also able to share and comment on other's posts. This software uses a variety of files, database storage, and technology. Any post on the home page can be seen and clicked to see further information provided by the user. The author of both the post and the comments will be visible.

If a user wants to start journalling their workout, they can register for a account or log in to an existing one. They now have access to a dashboard where they may post and track their workouts.

The user can then logout and discontinue their session, or the session can be timed out. The user is also able to edit the post or add other post onto the page. Users can also delete their posts.
